pyKlock - a clock with a k.

A multifunction timing thingy, where some [but not necessary all] of the things are useful.

pyKlock serves as a vehicle by which I learn and tinker with programming.

Previous versions of pyKlock have existed in VB.net, Lazarus [Free Pascal] and Free Basic - and may again.

Current version of pyKlock is written in Python using different GUI frameworks

	pyKlock 0 - pygubu & pySimpleGUI - finaly settled on pySimpleGUI.  
	pyKlock 1 - CustomTkinter [Most complete].
	pyKlock 2 - Flet.
	pyKlock 3 - QT.
	oyKlock 4 - wxPython.


A klock built using Python and wxPython GUI Framework.

Using python 3.14.0 and wxPython 4.2.4.

Note : I use the correct spelling of colour on my side of the code.  :-)

pyKlock displays the time [local], date, key status and the computers idle time.
Key status is the status of Caps Lock, Insert, Scroll lock and Num lock.
